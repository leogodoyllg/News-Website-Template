            </h3>
            <p>A Jewish family is suing the Guggenheim Museum for the return of a 1904 Picasso painting that was sold by the family under duress to escape Nazi persecution in 1938. The family alleges that the painting was sold well below value to the son of the Munich gallery owner who was aware of their plight. They are seeking the painting's return or compensation of its estimated market value of between $100 million and $200 million. The Guggenheim Museum states that they believe the suit to be without merit, and that the sale was a fair transaction between parties.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>Residents of Kalynivske, Ukraine have slowly trickled back home despite the lack of basic services, shelling, and danger of leftover mines. Residents have been relying on humanitarian aid, makeshift candles, and foraging for firewood to survive, but the constant danger of Russian attacks has made normalcy an elusive dream. Despite the deprivation, residents remain in the village as an act of defiance against the Russian occupation.</p>

          <p>The Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement was founded in 2017 by Joe Biden, and is now at the center of controversy due to the discovery of some classified documents in a locked closet in Biden's former office. Biden had used the center to plan his presidential campaign, and it has now been revealed that the center received donations from foreign donors, including China. The budget for the center comes solely from university funds.</p>
